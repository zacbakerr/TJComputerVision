Goal: Identify possible centers
- Step 1: Apply canny edge to the image
- Step 2: For each edge, vote on the direction of the gradient (not the rounded angle)
  - You have edge (x, y) and theta angle of the gradient -> find intersection with the border
    - Use Bresenham to vote (each pixel on the bresenham line increases by 1)
  - At the end of this loop, pixels around the center accumulate more votes
- Step 3: Create imagev.ppm with same width and heigh but the max rgb is the maximum number of votes
- Step 4: Apply threshold > TC
  - >= is a candidate for center else is not
  - All center candidates are 1s and everything else is a 0

- Optimization one: find a max value for a coin (Ex: 50)
  - Vote only in that area (Ex: 50 + 5)
  - Reduce voting area
