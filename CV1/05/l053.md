- Gx and Gy have 0 border
- We calculated Gmagnitude = sqrt(Gx^2 + Gy^2)
- Gdirection = theta = atan2(Gy, Gx)

Non Maxiumum Suppression
- Convert every angle to the defined angle its closest to (0, 45, 90, 135, 180, -45, -90, -135)
- If you're in the middle go to the lower value
- On the direction of the gradient, if P is greater than or equal to P1 and P2, then P is an edge

Combine NMS and Hystereses by placing edges where there is a 2 in hystereses AND 1 from NMS
